# Vision: Habit Tracking App
<br/>
<br/>

2021 is going to start soon. It is a great idea to make vision board for new year, make new habits, resolutions, affirmations and manage time to practise those habits. This app provides you a simple interface where you can login and start your own vision board. You can add new habits with affirmations and inspiring photos which can be updated later on. To each habit you can add new sessions every time you pratice and see your progress in bar chart. Each habit displays a randomly fetched quote for further inspiration. On vision board you can also see how much time you are giving to pratise each habit and how much time of the day is being tracked.

Enjoy!
